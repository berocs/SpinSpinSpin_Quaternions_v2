NOTE(s):
- Rotating object kinematics is "**scalar first unit quaternion**" based.
- The project "**SpinSpinSpin_Quaternion_v1**" is similar to this project.
- The project "**SpinSpinSpin_RotationVector**" is similar to this project but "**RotationVector**" based.
- Scalar First Unit Quaternion Definition:
  - A scalar first unit quaternion is a one dimensional row or column vector of length four.
    - **Use Equation (22) on Page 264 of Reference [ 1 ]** 
      - **EXCEPT:**
       - **[ 1 ]  Equation (22) is scalar LAST.**
       - **[ 2 ]  Here scalar FIRST is used.**
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are solved using the  Matlab "ode45" function to apply the Dorman-Prince 4(5) explicit embedded adaptive time step Runge-Kutta method.
  - Error limits in Matlab "ode45" function set to 10<sup>-13</sup>.
- State Vector Components:
  - State Vector components 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the "Scalar First Unit Quaternion".
  - State Vector components 5, 6 and 7 are the angular velocity vector.
  - Initial Conditions:
    - Scalar First Unit Quaternion:  [ cos( 0.5 ); sin( 0.5 ); 0.0; 0.0 ].
      - This will result in a 1 [radian] (57.3 [degrees]) rotation about the body X axis.
    - Angular Velocity: [  0.10;  0.00001;  0.0 ] [radians/second]
      - Spin about body X axis with a small spin about the body Y axis.
    - Principal components of moments of inertia:  [  4.0;   1.0;      9.0 ]
      - Rectangular block dimensions determined by principal components of moments of inertia.
      - Spin will be about the rectangular block axis of intermediate length.
- Time rate of change of the Scalar First Unit Quaternion:
  - To determine the time rate of change of the Scalar First Unit Quaternion, **use a combination of the following two items**:
     - **The FIRST PART of Equation (46) on Page 266 of Reference [ 1 ]**.
       - **This states that the time rate of change of the attitude quaterion is equal to the cross product of two quaternions:**
         -  **The pure quaternion container of the angular velocity 3D vector.**
         -  **The attitude quaternion.**

    - **Equation (305) on Page 482 of Reference [ 2 ]**.
      - **This equation shows how to use the quaternion product when the quaternion cross product is specified.**
      - **Here the angular velocity is contained in a "pure" scalar first quaternion in the sense of Equation (182) on Page 466 of Reference [ 2 ]**
      - **(except that Equation (182) is scalar last).**
      - **Also note Equation (30) on Page 265 of Reference [ 1 ]**

- Note that the 2D plots of inertial angular momentum quantities reveal the constant nature of the inertial angular momentum over time as expected for free rotation.
  - Change is within 10<sup>-13</sup>.
- Note that the 2D plot of rotational kinetic energy reveals the constant nature of this energy over time as expected for free rotation.
  - Change is within 10<sup>-13</sup>.
- Note that the 3D animation video reveals the constant nature of the angular momentum vector over time as expected for free rotation.
  - Simulation generates a rotation vector solution every millisecond for 1000 seconds generating a total of one million rotation vector solutions.
  - Simulation creates a sequence of 3D animation frames, one 3D animation frame for every 200 th rotation vector solution.  3D simulation animation frames are at 5 [frames/second] rate.
